# shelepuginivan's dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! 

Here you'll find a comprehensive collection of my configuration files. To get
the most out of this repository, I recommend that you selectively copy parts of
configurations and scripts that suit your needs, rather than cloning the entire
setup.

## Structure

- `.config` - configuration files
- `.local/bin` - shell scripts and utilities
- `.local/share/applications` - .desktop files for scripts

Note that this repository contains submodules for large configurations such as
the [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/shelepuginivan/init.lua).
