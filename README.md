# shelepuginivan's dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! 

Here you'll find a comprehensive collection of my configuration files. To get
the most out of this repository, I recommend that you selectively copy parts of
configurations and scripts that suit your needs, rather than cloning the entire
setup.

## Navigation

For your convenience &mdash; a table of directories.

Note that this repository contains submodules for large configurations such as
my [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/shelepuginivan/init.lua).
